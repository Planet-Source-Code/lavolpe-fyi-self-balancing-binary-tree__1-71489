### Description

For those that like linked lists, heaps, hash tables, etc, here is a self-balancing binary tree. If you are not familiar with binary trees, I included an RTF document to help understand them. For the rest of us, we know a worse-case binary tree is a linked list, and a best case binary tree is probably a Red-Black or AVL tree. A close runner up is a binary tree that has nodes added randomly, and then a better solution might just be this, a self-balancing binary tree. The tree does not balance perfectly, rather it balances its height on insertions and deletions maintaining a worse-case O(Log n)+1 search time. Not bad at all ;)
